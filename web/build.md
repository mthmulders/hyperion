# Building the frontend
There are two ways to build the Hyperion frontend

## For development
Just run

    npm install
    npm run build-dev

Or you could run `npm run dev-server` as the last command instead to have a full webserver with hot reloading.

## For production
Just run

    npm install
    npm run build-prod
